3rd or 4th attempt at this game. Reimporting old code and parsing it to get a working engine again.


To Do:
Reimport old code
Create a document to manage work flow
Create a new game design document on Notion
Reintegrate old code.


maybe create a 2d scene and then a 2.5d scene for when i do gradual export. 
( worse comes to worse i have to change some of the physics around but i dont see it as being difficult to upgrade to 2.5d.
getting to working order again in 2d is important as thats where i was.)

Create/ find working graphics place holders
